# Twitter-Wrapper
TwitterWrapper is an application that delivers e-mails with Tweets (from Twitter.com) based on a request received by mail.

The application uses Twitter4j and JavaMail to retrieve Tweets and send them by mail.

To build the application:
- Maven
- Java 1.7

The application is configured to use a Gmail account, you can replace the generic e-mail in the code with your own e-mail address and password. You need also to generate your access tokens for your Twitter account and replace them in the code as well. (You can find it at http://apps.twitter.com)
